The AI engineer successfully built the FilaTag RFID programmer, iteratively responding to user feedback and progressively enhancing the application. The initial phase focused on building the core MVP, integrating Proxmark3 CLI (with mock mode), a React frontend, and a FastAPI backend, along with CLI functionality and basic logging. This included setting up the project structure, dependencies, and essential CRUD operations.

Subsequent iterations addressed critical user requests for automation (auto-detection, barcode scanning), extensive UI/UX refinements (simplified status, comprehensive settings, branding integration), and major design overhauls for a 7-inch touchscreen. The engineer diligently debugged issues, particularly in mock mode verification and frontend rendering. The current task involves resolving Python dependency version conflicts to support embedded device deployment, specifically after the user reported an installation error requiring Python 3.10+. The work demonstrates a strong iterative development cycle and keen attention to both functionality and user experience.

<product_requirements>
The FilaTag application is designed to program two 13.56 MHz MIFARE Classic S50 (1K) RFID tags on each Filaform filament spool using a Proxmark3 512M connected over USB. It must run as a lightweight headless app on a Linux SBC (e.g., Raspberry Pi) with a responsive web UI.

Key features include:
*   **Hardware Integration**: Interface with Proxmark3 (Iceman fork v4.18994+) with auto-detection and a robust mock/simulation mode.
*   **Filament Management**: Present a searchable list of filaments, resolving binary files from  via .
*   **Programming Workflow**:
    *   Prompt for Tag #1 placement, write binary, verify, display PASS/FAIL, record log.
    *   Repeat for Tag #2.
    *   UI to show real-time Proxmark CLI output, progress, status, retries, elapsed time.
*   **Verification**: Read back sectors, compare bytewise/SHA256. Configurable strictness and retries.
*   **Logging**: Structured newline-delimited JSON logs to  with timestamps, operator, SKU, spool ID, tag index, binary name, hash, Proxmark output, retries, and result.
*   **CLI Mode**: Headless tool to program a spool by SKU.
*   **Security**: Optional basic auth (currently not required), file permissions,  service for autostart.
*   **Installation**: Documentation for dependencies, udev rules, , adding binaries, mapping SKUs.
*   **UI/UX**: Simple, clean web UI with filament list, Program spool button, programming modal, progress bar, live console, verification, log viewer. Optimized for 7-inch touchscreen (1024x600 resolution).
*   **Automation (Enhancements)**: Auto-detection of tag placement to start programming, removal of manual spool ID/operator inputs, camera barcode scanning (UPC/EAN) for auto-selecting filament type.
*   **Settings (Enhancements)**: Comprehensive settings tab for camera enable/disable, auto RFID detection enable/disable, device paths.
*   **Branding**: Integrated Filaform FilaTag branding with provided logos, refined UI for better visual appeal.
*   **Deployment**: Native desktop application for direct launch on embedded devices like Sonic Pad (sonic-debian) without a browser.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python backend for API endpoints and business logic.
- **React**: Frontend framework for the web UI, utilizing Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing application data (though not explicitly used for persistence in the trajectory, it's part of the stack).
- **Proxmark3 CLI**: Hardware interaction via Python  calls.
- **Mock Mode**: Simulation of Proxmark3 responses for testing.
- **OpenCV & Pyzbar**: Python libraries for camera-based barcode scanning.
- **Systemd**: Service management for autostart on Linux SBC.
- **Environment Variables**: For secure configuration of URLs and database connections.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB (though database interactions are not heavily featured in the trajectory's observed code changes).



**Key Files and Changes:**
- : The central backend file. It contains FastAPI routes for device status, filament listing, tag programming, logging, and clearing logs. It handles subprocess calls to Proxmark3, integrates  and  for automated workflows, and manages mock mode simulations. Significant edits involved refining mock mode logic for device detection and tag verification, integrating new API endpoints for automation, and adding log clearing functionality.
- : The main React component. It manages the application's state, handles routing between tabs (Programming, Device Status, Logs, Settings), interacts with the backend API, and renders the UI components. It underwent extensive modifications for UI redesigns, integrating the automated workflow steps, implementing the  component, and optimizing for the 7-inch touchscreen. It also incorporated Filaform branding elements.
- : Contains custom CSS styles, heavily modified to implement the various UI/UX improvements, including gradients, button styles, layout adjustments for touchscreen, and overall aesthetic refinements to match the Filaform branding.

<pending_tasks>
- **Python Version Compatibility**: Adjust backend  to align with Python 3.8+ compatibility for embedded devices.
- **Native Desktop App Implementation**: Implement the  wrapper to launch the web UI directly on embedded devices without a browser (e.g., using a webview library).
- **Proxmark Output Streaming**: The initial requirements mentioned SSE or WebSockets for streaming Proxmark output to the UI; it's not explicitly confirmed if this was fully implemented.
- **Actual Camera Integration**: While barcode scanning logic is in place, its integration with actual camera hardware (beyond mock mode) needs to be tested in the target environment.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical issue reported by the user: an install error saying python version greater 3.10 required from the backend in requirements.txt. This error occurs during the installation of backend dependencies on the Sonic Pad embedded device, which likely runs an older Python version (e.g., Python 3.8 or 3.9). The engineer's immediate task is to examine the  file and modify its package version constraints to ensure compatibility with Python 3.8+ as recommended for the embedded device. This involves potentially loosening specific package version requirements that might be implicitly tied to newer Python versions. The goal is to make the backend installable and runnable on the target hardware's Python environment.

<optional_next_step>
Modify the  file in the backend to ensure compatibility with Python 3.8 or higher.
